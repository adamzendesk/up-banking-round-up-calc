## up-banking-round-up-calc

A Ruby script to calculate your total round ups for an Up Savers account.

To use this script you'll need to get your Up token [here](https://api.up.com.au/) to populate `token` and you'll also need to collect your SAVER account id using the [get accounts endpoint](https://developer.up.com.au/#get_accounts) to populate `account_id`.

Running the script calculates the total amount you've saved using [Up Bank's round ups feature](https://up.com.au/features/round-ups/). Seeing a total isn't in their app yet so I thought it'd be fun to see how much I'd saved.
